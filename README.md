Flows comparible to the ARDX kit experiments

### About

Exploring Node-RED flows that do that same as, or simulate, the experiments from the [ARDX](https://wcrsyyc.github.io/ardx/) kit. Initially this is demonstrating the logic needed to match the functionality of the experiment sketches. Keeping the structure such that the currently simulated hardware could be easily replaced by an interface to the real thing.
